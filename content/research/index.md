My line of research focus on lifespan development in:

### (1) Temporal Self
One of my ongoing projects studies the age differences in temporal self-continuity, i.e., the psychological connectedness between our current self and a distant past/ future self. 

### (2) Social Relations
Iâ€™m also interested in the socially extensive self, such as the social discounting that people offer benefits to others according to the perceived social distance. 

### (3) Decision-Making
A deeper understanding of our temporally and socially extended selves can ultimately help us to improve real-life decisions, such as investments and generativity.
