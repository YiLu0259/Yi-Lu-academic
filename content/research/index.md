My line of research focus on lifespan development in:

### (1) Temporal Self
My current research focus on the age differences in **temporal self-continuity**, i.e., the psychological connectedness between our current self and a distant past/ future self. Our latest project examined the robustedness of such age-related structual differences in self-contnuity, by involving multiple datasets collected across age groups, time and countries.

Our next step is to develop an advanced modeling approach by applying economic discounting models to self-continuity.

### (2) Social Self
Iâ€™m also interested in the extended self in social relations. One example is **social discounting**, i.e., people offer benefits to others according to the perceived social distance. We are currently conducting a cross-cultural survey on age-related differences in social discounting.

### (3) Decision-Making
A deeper understanding of our temporally and socially extended selves can ultimately help us to improve real-life decisions, such as investments and generativity, especially for older adults.
