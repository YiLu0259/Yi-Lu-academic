      My methodological training spans both quantitative and qualitative approaches, including self-reported surveys, behavioral experiments and structured interviews. I am proficient in data collection in both online and laboratory settings, cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, and a broad range of analytic techniques, such as thematic analysis of text responses, multilevel modeling, Bayesian and nonparametric statistics, structural regression models, time-series analysis, and longitudinal approaches to fixed effects and hybrid models. Leveraging this toolkit, I strive to address methodological limitations in previous research by developing and adopting advanced methods in my research, alongside open science practices.
