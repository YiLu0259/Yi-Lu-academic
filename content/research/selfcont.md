      Self-continuity, the perceived connectedness with our past and future selves at different time points, is a cornerstone of self-identity. It is associated with preventive decisions, health-promoting behaviors, life satisfaction, and well-being at both individual and societal levels, while lower self-continuity is linked to depression and suicidal ideation (Sedikides et al., 2023). Yet, our understanding of how self-continuity varies across contexts remains limited. To address this gap and inform both implications for subjective well-being and health policies, my research investigates the temporal pattern of self-continuity across age, culture, and major life transitions.
