My research centers on two interconnected aspects of the aging process: **self-continuity** and **decision-making**, and their implications for lifelong well-being. These topics address fundamental questions of everyday life: 

(1) *How do we view ourselves across the past, present, and future?*

(2) *How do we make decisions that shape our future?*

To do so, I combine **quantitative methodologies** with qualitative evidence, including behavioral experiments, large-scale online surveys, and text responses, and apply advanced statistical models to uncover nuanced patterns in the data.
