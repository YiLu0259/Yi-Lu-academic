My lines of research focus on lifespan development in:


### (1) From Past to Future: Self-Continuity

Self-continuity, the perceived connectedness with our past and future selves at different time points, is a cornerstone of self-identity. It is associated with preventive decisions, health-promoting behaviors, life satisfaction, and well-being at both individual and societal levels, while lower self-continuity is linked to depression and suicidal ideation (Sedikides et al., 2023). Yet, our understanding of how self-continuity varies across contexts remains limited. To address this gap and inform both implications for subjective well-being and health policies, my research investigates the **temporal pattern of self-continuity across age, culture, and major life transitions**.

### (2) The Self in Decision-Making
How we perceive ourselves plays a vital role in shaping our decisions. For older adults, age-related changes in cognitive resources present unique challenges to decision-making. In response, I examine how older adults’ view of future selves and their age group influence decision-making in intertemporal and risky contexts.

### (3) Decision-Making
According to socioemotional selectivity theory (SST; Carstensen, 1992), as people age, they prioritize their social and emotional goals. This shift has important implications for older adults’ judgment and decision-making, particularly given their heightened vulnerability to elder abuse and financial fraud. My ongoing work aims to uncover the age-related differences in judgments and decisions in social contexts.
