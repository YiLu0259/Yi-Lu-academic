      According to the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (Carstensen, 1992), as people age, they prioritize their social and emotional goals. This shift has important implications for older adults’ judgment and decision-making, particularly given their heightened vulnerability to elder abuse and financial fraud. My ongoing work aims to uncover the age-related differences in judgments and decisions in social contexts.
