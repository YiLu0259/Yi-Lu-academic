abstract: This study examined whether the average levels and the temporal
  extension of self-continuity varied over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Three demographically matched adult life-span samples (n = 223 each) were
  gathered in the U.S. in fall 2016, summer 2020, and winter 2022/23.
  Participants rated their self-continuity 1/5/10 years into the past and
  future. Multi-level analyses examined the effects of temporal distance,
  past/future direction, and assessment time while controlling for demographics.
  The tendencies to report lower self-continuity for more distant times and for
  past versus future were weaker during the pandemic, and past/future
  differences remained after the pandemic. Discussion focuses on the possibility
  of mid-pandemic slowed time perception, increasing nostalgic self-reflection,
  and uncertainty about the future.
