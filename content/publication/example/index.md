abstract: Older adults tend to rate unfamiliar faces higher on trustworthiness
  than do their younger counterparts. Although the saying goes “look before you
  leap”, it is still unknown whether such a strategy could also apply to facial
  trustworthiness perception, and our understanding of the time course in facial
  trustworthiness perception also remains unclear. Here, we have argued that a
  cognitive controlled process suggested by “socioemotional selectivity theory”
  could potentially lead to such biased trustworthiness perception. Two
  experiments were conducted to test the association between viewing time and
  trustworthiness perception. The first study used hierarchical linear modeling
  in a sample of younger (N = 30, Mage = 20.53, SD = 1.61, 50% female) and older
  (N = 30, Mage = 63.27, SD = 3.14, 43% female) adults, and found that viewing
  time and trustworthiness evaluation were positively associated. Using the same
  stimuli, our second study further manipulated viewing time by two levels
  (500 ms vs. 3000 ms) and compared younger (N = 28, Mage = 23.93, SD = 2.68,
  50% female) and older (N = 30, Mage = 64.47, SD = 4.32, 50% female) adults'
  facial trustworthiness evaluation. As expected, a significant three-way
  interaction revealed that viewing time only impacted older adults' facial
  trustworthiness evaluation, and only when given shorter viewing time did older
  adults show similar facial trustworthiness ratings as younger adults. The
  present study is the first to directly investigate the relationship between
  older adults' viewing time on unfamiliar faces and their perception of facial
  trustworthiness. Findings suggested that a second thought in facial perception
  may not benefit older adults' trustworthiness evaluation.
