abstract: Self-continuity (i.e., people's sense of connectedness with their past
  and future selves) declines with increasing distance from the present moment.
  Questions remain about the specific patterns of such temporal declines and
  about potential associations between self-continuity and temporal discounting
  (i.e., the tendency to devalue delayed outcomes). In response, the present
  research assessed both past and future self-continuity as well as temporal
  discounting across multiple time intervals in two U.S. adult lifespan samples
  (n = 86/461). Analyses examined the associations between self-continuity and
  temporal discounting and fitted mathematical models from the temporal
  discounting literature (exponential/hyperbolic/q-exponential) to
  self-continuity. The q-exponential model provided the best fit for both
  self-continuity and temporal discounting data. However, associations between
  temporal discounting and past or future self-continuity were only found at
  single intervals but not for average levels or slope parameters. Theoretical
  implications, methodological limitations, and future directions are discussed.
