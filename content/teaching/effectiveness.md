## What students said after attending my courses
### [HD1130/PSYCH1131] Introduction to Human Development
> I really enjoyed the part of this class that was ***interactive***, such as the group project and the discussion. I enjoyed that I was not required to meet daily but instead got to communicate with others through our work. I also felt that the daily quizzes were extremely helpful as they helped me ***grasp the concepts more*** and allowed for constant grades, which I felt to be extremely helpful.

> It introduced ***in depth knowledge*** about human development from prenatal development all the way to death. I love how we had ***multiple ways to show our learning***, such as through discussions, quizzes, and group presentations. The extra credits were also interesting to do, such as the World Map of Human Development or Article Analysis.

> The lectures were very ***organized***, which made the class a lot more manageable. Further, when sensitive topics were discussed, the instructors did so with ***care and compassion***. They also provided us with the necessary resources if we were upset by the topics.

### [HD2180] Human Development: Adulthood and Aging
> Very ***practical information*** that I feel will help me interact with all people even going into a field unrelated to gerontology. Professor Lu also went out of her way to ***be available to us*** in an online asynchronous class, and I greatly appreciate that.

## What students said in courses I TAed
### [HD1170] Human Development: Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood

>	[She] went out of her way to anticipate issues before they occurred, ***proactive and engaged*** at all times.

## What attendees said after attending workshops I led
