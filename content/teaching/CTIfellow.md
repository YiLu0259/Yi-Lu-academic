I was awarded the teaching fellowship at [Cornell Center for Teaching Innovation (CTI)](https://teaching.cornell.edu/grants-awards/graduate-students-postdoctoral-fellows) since 2023 and am currently a **senior lead fellow** at CTI, co-leading a group of 20 graduate teaching fellows from different disciplines across the campus. At CTI, we design and implement teaching programs, events, and resources that foster teaching excellence and innovation. As a senior lead fellow, I also develop **leadership and mentorship skills**, reflect on and refine my pedagogical skills, enhance my communication skills, and foster collaborative, interdisciplinary teaching networks across the university, such as the [Ivy+ Teaching Transformation Summit](https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/programs-for-graduate-students/seminars-institutes-for-graduate-students/teaching-transformations/).
