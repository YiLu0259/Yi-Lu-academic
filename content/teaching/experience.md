# Teaching Interests
I am prepared to teach a range of introductory and advanced courses in **aging and lifespan development**, **judgment and decision making**, **self and identity**, and **social psychology**. I am also prepared to teach **research methods and statistics** at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, including experiment design, measurements, and quantitative methods such as multilevel modeling.

# Teaching Experience
## Instructor of Record
### [HD2180] *Human Development: Adulthood and Aging*
Offered term: Summer 2025, online

<details>
<summary>Course Aim</summary>

What do we gain and lose as we age? How do our relationships change over time? How does population aging influence our society? How should we approach aging research, and how can we translate our findings into concrete policies? This course provides an overview of biological, cognitive, and socio-emotional development across the adult life span with a particular focus on the later years. We will consider what age-related changes mean for research, clinical, and policy settings. Different aspects of development will be integrated within a multidisciplinary life-span developmental framework.

<summary>Specific Learning Objectives</summary>

By the end of this course, you will: 
  
- Describe changes in different aspects of functioning across the adult life span
- Integrate theoretical perspectives on aging across disciplines
- Read and understand contemporary research in gerontology
- Translate current findings in the aging literature to policy, programs, and practice
- Recognize the great diversity and resilience among older people
- Re-examine your personal attitudes about older people and your own aging process

### [HD1130/PSYCH1131] *Introduction to Human Development*
Offered term: Summer 2024, online

<details>
<summary>Course Aim</summary>

Introduction to Human Development provides a broad and foundational overview of the field of human development, starting from conception and ending through the process of death and dying. The course will start with an outline and explanation of the lifespan perspective in human development. The biological beginnings of life and prenatal development will serve as the start of the discussion of human development, followed by an exploration of physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development at each subsequent stage within the lifespan (e.g., infancy, early, middle & late childhood, etc.). Discussion of each developmental stage will highlight major research findings and their real-world application.

<summary>Specific Learning Objectives</summary>

By the end of this course, you will:

-	Develop a broad but strong base of knowledge surrounding the field of human development and how human development research is conducted. 
-	Be able to read, understand, and critically think about current research in the field of human development and how research can be applied to the real world. 
-	Gain an understanding of the different developmental stages and what kind of change is occurring across the domains of physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development. 
-	Consider your beliefs about development before the course and reconsider the beliefs that are not supported by research. 
-	Find this class fun and interesting, taking what you learned from the course and being able to apply it in your daily life!

## Guest Lectures and Workshops Given
<details>
<summary><b>Cognitive Aging for [COGST 1101] <i>Introduction to Cognitive Science</i></b></summary>

In this lecture, we discussed the age-related changes in the brain, attention, and memory with a special focus on older adulthood. After this lecture, students had an understanding of neurobiological changes in brain structure and functions and age differences in different types of attention and memory across various contexts, with practical advice on their preparation for the aging process and interactions with older adults.

<summary><b>Essentials of Teaching Institute</b></summary>

In this four-part workshop series we developed, participants will explore strategies to foster a positive classroom environment, create effective interactive teaching activities to help students learn, and develop fair methods for assessment and grading. Since 2023, I have instructed all four workshops in this institute, covering the following topics:

1. Role of TAs in Cultivating an Inclusive Classroom
2. Supporting Student Learning as a TA
3. Effective Grading and Feedback
4. Final Session: Discussion of an Action Plan

  <summary><b>Teaching Portfolio Program</b></summary>
  
  In this in-person program, I co-instructed two workshops for graduate TAs and instructors-in-training on developing Teaching Philosophy Statements and Inclusivity Statements.
