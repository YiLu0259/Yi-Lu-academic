As a developmental psychologist and gerontologist, my teaching philosophy is centered on the belief that the ultimate goal of education is for personal fulfillment and lifespan development. To achieve this goal, I believe in implementing the “3Is”: **Inclusive**, **Independent**, and **Integrative**, in my teaching.
