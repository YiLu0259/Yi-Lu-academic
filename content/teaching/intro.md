As a developmental psychologist and gerontologist, my teaching philosophy is centered on the belief that the ultimate goal of education is for personal fulfillment and lifespan development. To achieve this goal, I believe in implementing the “3Is” in my teaching: 
**Inclusive**
**Independent**
**Integrative**
