# Teaching Philosophy
As a developmental psychologist and gerontologist, my teaching philosophy is centered on the belief that the ultimate goal of education is for personal fulfillment and lifespan development. To achieve this goal, I implement the following elements in my teaching: 

<details>
<summary><b>Inclusivity</b></summary>
Being an international student myself, I understand the importance of creating an inclusive classroom environment. With Cornell CTI fellows, we discussed Bell Hooks' <i>Teaching to Transgress</i> and Paulo Freire's <i>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</i>. In my classroom, I strive to create a welcoming and inclusive learning environment where every student feels seen, valued, and empowered to contribute their ideas. To achieve this, I get to know each of my students through <b>pre-class and mid-term surveys</b>, with <b>open spaces for discussion</b>. Moreover, I intentionally <b>diversify my teaching materials</b>, adopt accessible formats, avoid negative or deficit-based narratives, and present <b>role models and research from underrepresented groups</b>.
</details>
  
<details>
<summary><b>Independence</b></summary>
I believe that autonomy in learning is crucial for students’ success in transitioning from high school to undergraduate and graduate studies. To achieve this goal, <b>scaffolding</b> is necessary, and the foundation of scaffolding is to create a secure attachment between the instructor and students. To achieve this, I create an environment that encourages <b>trial and error</b> as part of the learning process, for example, by providing constructive feedback via the compliment sandwich model and the “Yes, and” thinking, and by fostering peer learning through discussion boards and study groups. Besides, I introduced my students to resources that address the “hidden curriculum”, including academic accommodations, external reviews, and the writing center, and effective reading and time management strategies. I also integrate the <b>self-regulation model</b> to facilitate students' personal growth. 
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Integrative design</b></summary>
I am committed to designing integrative courses that combine reinforcement among learning goals, teaching/learning activities, and feedback/assessments with attention to situational factors. I develop my classes using <b>backward design</b> and <b>Bloom's taxonomy</b>, aligning class activities with learning objectives at different levels. Throughout my course, I employ strategies such as anonymous feedback and <b>backstage agenda</b> to pace course progression. Moreover, I incorporate <b>Universal Design of Learning</b> principles, for example, by accommodating diverse learning styles through <b>multiple modalities</b> such as videos, visual aids, student presentations, and hands-on sessions. To complement summative assessment (e.g., exams and final paper), I incorporate <b>low-stakes formative assessments</b> (e.g., after-class quizzes with quick feedback and resubmission options) to facilitate continuous learning. In response to the rise of Generative AI, I include an <b>AI policy</b> in my syllabi that sets clear expectations and encourages the thoughtful integration of AI into intellectual work.

# Center for Teaching Innovation
I was awarded the teaching fellowship at [Cornell Center for Teaching Innovation (CTI)](https://teaching.cornell.edu/grants-awards/graduate-students-postdoctoral-fellows) since 2023 and am currently a **senior lead fellow** at CTI, co-leading a group of 20 graduate teaching fellows from different disciplines across the campus. At CTI, we design and implement teaching programs, events, and resources that foster teaching excellence and innovation. As a senior lead fellow, I also develop leadership and mentorship skills, reflect on and refine my teaching skills, enhance my communication skills, and foster collaborative, interdisciplinary teaching networks across the university, such as the [Ivy+ Teaching Transformation Summit](https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/programs-for-graduate-students/seminars-institutes-for-graduate-students/teaching-transformations/).

# Teaching Interests and Experience
I am prepared to teach a range of introductory and advanced courses in **aging and lifespan development**, **judgment and decision making**, **self and identity**, and **social psychology**. I am also prepared to teach **research methods and statistics** at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, including experiment design, measurements, and quantitative methods such as multilevel modeling.

## Instructor of Record
### [HD2180] *Human Development: Adulthood and Aging*
Offered term: Summer 2025, online

<details>
<summary>Course Aim</summary>
<br>
What do we gain and lose as we age? How do our relationships change over time? How does population aging influence our society? How should we approach aging research, and how can we translate our findings into concrete policies? This course provides an overview of biological, cognitive, and socio-emotional development across the adult life span with a particular focus on the later years. We will consider what age-related changes mean for research, clinical, and policy settings. Different aspects of development will be integrated within a multidisciplinary life-span developmental framework.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Specific Learning Objectives</summary>

By the end of this course, you will: 
  
- Describe changes in different aspects of functioning across the adult life span
- Integrate theoretical perspectives on aging across disciplines
- Read and understand contemporary research in gerontology
- Translate current findings in the aging literature to policy, programs, and practice
- Recognize the great diversity and resilience among older people
- Re-examine your personal attitudes about older people and your own aging process
</details>

### [HD1130/PSYCH1131] *Introduction to Human Development*
Offered term: Summer 2024, online

<details>
<summary>Course Aim</summary>

Introduction to Human Development provides a broad and foundational overview of the field of human development, starting from conception and ending through the process of death and dying. The course will start with an outline and explanation of the lifespan perspective in human development. The biological beginnings of life and prenatal development will serve as the start of the discussion of human development, followed by an exploration of physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development at each subsequent stage within the lifespan (e.g., infancy, early, middle & late childhood, etc.). Discussion of each developmental stage will highlight major research findings and their real-world application. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Specific Learning Objectives</summary>

By the end of this course, you will:

-	Develop a broad but strong base of knowledge surrounding the field of human development and how human development research is conducted. 
-	Be able to read, understand, and critically think about current research in the field of human development and how research can be applied to the real world. 
-	Gain an understanding of the different developmental stages and what kind of change is occurring across the domains of physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development. 
-	Consider your beliefs about development before the course and reconsider the beliefs that are not supported by research. 
-	Find this class fun and interesting, taking what you learned from the course and being able to apply it in your daily life!
