# Teaching Philosophy
As a developmental psychologist and gerontologist, my teaching philosophy is centered on the belief that the ultimate goal of education is for personal fulfillment and lifespan development. To achieve this goal, I implement the following elements in my teaching: 
- **Inclusivity**. Being an international student myself, I understand the importance of creating an inclusive classroom environment. With Cornell CTI lead fellows, we discussed Bell Hooks' *Teaching to Transgress* and Paulo Freire's *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*.
- **Independence**. I believe that autonomy in learning is crucial for studentsâ€™ success in transitioning from high school to undergraduate and graduate studies. To achieve this goal, *scaffolding* is necessary, and the foundation of scaffolding is to create a secure attachment between the instructor and students.
- **Integrative design**. I am committed to designing integrative courses via pedagogical and psychological methods. An integrative course combines reinforcement among learning goals, teaching/learning activities, and feedback/assessments with attention to situational factors.
