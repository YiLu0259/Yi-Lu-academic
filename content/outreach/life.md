## Serve the Community
Alongside my research, I have served as a senior graduate student representative in the **Graduate Student Committee** of the Psychology Department from 2022 to 2024, for which I received the **Exceptional Department Service Award** in 2024.

Since 2023, I have been a founding member of the **Diversity and International Students Committee (DISC)** at Cornell in the [Graduate and Professional Student Assembly](https://assembly.cornell.edu/shared-governance-cornell/graduate-and-professional-student-assembly).

I also served on the **Cornelia Ye Teaching Assistant Award Selection Committee** in 2024 and have been serving on the **International Teaching Assistant Program Advisory Committee** since then.

## Beyond Cornell
In 2024, I was selected for the **Building Future Faculty Program** at North Carolina State University. During the two-and-a-half-day visit, I presented my dissertation work to faculty in the Department of Psychology at NC State, and attended sessions on faculty life at a research-intensive university, expectations for new faculty, and the available resources for research and teaching. I also had the opportunity to meet with scholars from other institutions and disciplines. 

I have also attended the **Computational Modeling Workshop** held by [SRNDNA](https://srndna.utdallas.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I engaged in immersive learning on the latest computational models in decision science.

## For Fun!
During my leisure, I enjoy spending time with my cats, handcrafting, and hiking.
