# Healthy Aging Lab
I have the privilege of working with a dynamic group of emerging scholars in Cornellâ€™s Healthy Aging Lab, representing diverse backgrounds from across the U.S. and around the world. We are driven by a shared curiosity about the socioemotional and cognitive factors that shape behavior and decision-making across the lifespan, especially for older adults.
