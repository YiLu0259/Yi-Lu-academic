I’m Yi Lu, currently working at the [Healthy Aging Lab](https://www.human.cornell.edu/hd/research/labs/healthyaging/home) at Cornell University, U.S. My research focus on lifespan development, especially people's aging process. One of my ongoing projects studies the age differences in temporal self-continuity, i.e., the psychological connectedness between our current self and a distant past/ future self. I’m also interested in the socially extensive self, such as the social discounting that people offer benefits to others according to the perceived social distance. In parallel to my research, I worked as a mentor for Extended Project Qualification (EPQ), assisting high school students on their first social science project. I have a cat named Pouncival.
