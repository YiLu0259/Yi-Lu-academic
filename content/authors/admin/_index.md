... pronounced as /ee/. 

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate working in the [Healthy Aging Lab](https://www.human.cornell.edu/hd/research/labs/healthyaging/home) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), U.S. Before that, I got my Bachelar's degree at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in China.
My research focuses on **lifespan development**, especially people's aging process in **self-concepts** and **social relations**, and **decision-making outcomes**. 

In parallel to my research, I serve as a member of the Grad Student Committee at the Psych Department, Cornell, Diversity and International Students Committee in Graduate and Professional Student
Assembly and work as a mentor for Extended Project Qualification.
