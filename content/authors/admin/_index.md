... pronounced as /ee/. 

I am currently a forth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Healthy Aging Lab](https://www.human.cornell.edu/hd/research/labs/healthyaging/home) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), U.S. Before that, I got my Bachelar's degree at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in China.
My research focuses on **lifespan development**, especially age-related differences in **self-concepts**, **social relations**, and **decision-making outcomes**.
