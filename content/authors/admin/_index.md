*Yi* is pronounced as /ee/. 

**Looking for both postdoc positions and assistant professorships starting summer 2026!**

I am currently a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Healthy Aging Lab at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), U.S. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in China.
My research centers on **lifespan development** in **self-concepts** and **decision-making processes**, with their implications for **well-being**. These topics address fundamental questions of everyday life: how we view ourselves across the past, present, and future, and how we make decisions that shape our future. 

To do so, I adopt quantitative methodologies, including behavioral experiments and large-scale surveys, supplemented with qualitative evidence such as text responses.
