title: "[APS 2025] Cultural Values and Social Discounting: Higher Collectivism
  is Associated with More Generosity toward Socially Distant Others"
abstract: "We examined the association between individualism/collectivism and
  social discounting in a U.S. lifespan sample (N=510, Mage =51.44, 260
  Females). Higher collectivism was significantly correlated with more
  generosity toward individuals and charities and a higher tendency to favor
  socially distant recipients, suggesting an association between cultural values
  and prosocial decisions. "
