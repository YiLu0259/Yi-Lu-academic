title: "[SPSP 2025] Personality Traits and Self-Continuity: Lower Neuroticism is
  Associated with Greater Connectedness with Past and Future Selves"
abstract: Self-continuity, the perceived connectedness with past and future
  selves, has been linked to lower neuroticism (Sedikides et al., 2023).
  However, little is known about its associations with other five-factor traits
  and differential effects for past versus future self-continuity. Three adult
  lifespan datasets, collected in 2020 (n=491), 2022 (n=163), and 2023 (n=477),
  assessed self-continuity 0.5/1/5/10 years into the past/future and measured
  personality traits with the BFI-10. Linear regressions examined traits as
  predictors of average past and future self-continuity across temporal
  distances. In all three datasets, lower neuroticism was consistently
  associated with higher past and future self-continuity. Other traits
  (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness) showed no
  significant association. Effects persisted after controlling for demographics,
  except in the 2020 dataset, where the association between future
  self-continuity and neuroticism was no longer significant. Findings expand our
  understanding of the associations between five-factor personality traits and
  perceptions of self-continuity over time.
