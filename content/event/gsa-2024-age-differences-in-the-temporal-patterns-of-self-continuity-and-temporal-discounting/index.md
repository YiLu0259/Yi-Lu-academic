title: "[GSA 2024] Age Differences in the Temporal Patterns of Self-Continuity
  and Temporal Discounting"
abstract: Self-continuity, the perceived connectedness with past and future
  selves, varies across the life span. Previous research found that both past
  and future self-continuity are positively associated with age and that such
  effects are more pronounced for more distant time intervals (Rutt &
  Löckenhoff, 2016). Questions remain about the appropriate mathematical
  modeling of such patterns and potential associations between age differences
  in self-continuity and temporal discounting, the tendency to devalue future
  outcomes. In response, the present study assessed both past and future
  self-continuity as well as temporal discounting across four temporal distances
  (0.5, 1, 5, 10 years) in a U.S. adult life-span sample (N=461, aged 18–96, M =
  51.38, SD =19.54, 52% female, 65% Non-Hispanic White). When compared to linear
  and exponential models, hyperbolic models provided the best fit for both
  self-continuity and temporal discounting. Subsequent analyses therefore
  focused on hyperbolic slope parameters (k) derived for each participant.
  Chronological age was negatively associated with k for both self-continuity
  and temporal discounting, indicating that, with age, the perceived
  connectedness with past/future selves and the perceived value of delayed
  rewards show fewer decrements with increasing temporal distance. However,
  although k parameters for past/future self-continuity were significantly
  associated with each other, they were not significantly associated with
  temporal discounting. Moreover, age differences in temporal discounting
  remained significant after controlling for age differences in past/future
  self-continuity. The present study extends our understanding of previously
  reported age differences in self-continuity and temporal discounting but
  suggests that they cannot be traced to the same underlying mechanism.
