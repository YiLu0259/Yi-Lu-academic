title: "[EPA 2025] Agreeableness is Associated with Increased Generosity in
  Social Discounting and Charitable Giving"
abstract: "Personality is associated with altruism (Oda et al., 2014), but
  associations to social discounting—declining generosity with increasing social
  distance—remain unclear. In a life-span sample (N=480), participants answered
  the BFI-10 and allocated $100 between themselves and recipients at five social
  distances or favorite charities. Higher agreeableness was consistently
  associated with more generous giving across social distances and to charities,
  and lower social discounting. Methodological limitations and directions for
  future research are discussed. "
