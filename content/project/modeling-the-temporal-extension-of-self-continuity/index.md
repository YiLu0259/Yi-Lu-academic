Explorations were hampered on the association between the decrease in self-continuity (i.e., feeling less connected with oneâ€™s more distant past and future selves) and temporal discounting (i.e., the tendency to devalue delayed outcomes) due to methodological limitations. The present study examines this association between self-continuity and monetary discounting and whether both decrements can be governed by the same mathematical function.
Two lifespan samples of local (n=91) and nationwide (n=485) adults were recruited. Participants indicated past and future self-continuity at multiple intervals and money they demand to delay an immediate reward for the same future intervals. We examined the correlations between averages of self-continuity and monetary discounting and fitted them with four prevalent discounting models (exponential/hyperbolic/q-exponential/quasi-hyperbolic).
