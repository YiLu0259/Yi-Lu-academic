This study examined the robustness of previously reported age differences in self-continuity in two adult life-span samples collected in Germany and the U.S. Consistent with the prior literature (for a review see LÃ¶ckenhoff & Rutt, 2016) average self-continuity was positively associated with chronological age (H1). We had further predicted that age differences would be more pronounced for more distant intervals (H2) and would not vary across past and future (H3), but these predictions were only partially supported, and results varied across samples.
