The present study examined whether the average levels and the temporal extension of self-continuity varied over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Three demographically matched adult life-span samples (n = 223 each) were gathered in the U.S. in fall 2016, early summer 2020, and winter 2022/23. Participants rated their self-continuity 1/5/10 years into the past and future. Multi-level analyses examined the effects of temporal distance, past/future direction, and assessment time and explored the role of demographic covariates.\
Average self-continuity did not differ across assessments, but compared to pre-pandemic times, mid-pandemic self-continuity ratings were more similar across past and future and across close and distant time points, even after controlling for demographic factors. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed.
