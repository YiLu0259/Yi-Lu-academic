Recent findings revealed systematic temporal variations of past and future self-continuity (Lu et al., 2023) that differ meaningfully across individuals and appear to be susceptible to major life changes (Lu & LÃ¶ckenhoff, 2024). However, there is a lack of understanding regarding how the temporal extensions of self-continuity relate to prior shifts in family and employment status. Using panel data, we aim to examine the associations of current status and previous changes in family and job with current self-continuity, both with respect to average self-continuity and with respect to temporal extensions of self-continuity.
