Extant research finds that individuals are biased in their temporal perceptions, perceiving an equidistant future moment as temporally closer to the present compared to a moment in the past. In the present research, including four studies (Studies 1a-1d) serving as direct replications and extensions of the original work (Caruso et al., 2013), we find no evidence of such a bias. Instead, we find that individuals report greater future rather than past self-continuity, especially for more distant than close future selves.
